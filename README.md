## Square Payment Setup

### 1. Get Square Credentials
1. Sign up for a [Square Developer Account](https://developer.squareup.com/)
2. Create a new application
3. Get your Application ID and Location ID
4. Generate access tokens for sandbox and production

### 2. Configure Square Settings
Update the configuration in `src/utils/squareConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const SQUARE_CONFIG = {
  applicationId: 'your-actual-app-id-here',
  locationId: 'your-actual-location-id-here',
  environment: 'sandbox', // or 'production'
  sdkUrl: 'https://sandbox.web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js',
};
```

### 3. Backend Integration
The payment service in `src/services/paymentService.ts` needs to connect to your backend API. Update the `baseUrl` and implement the actual API calls:

```typescript
// Replace mock implementation with real API calls
const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/payments/process`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(paymentRequest),
});
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with your Square credentials:

```env
REACT_APP_SQUARE_APP_ID=your_square_application_id
REACT_APP_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_square_location_id
REACT_APP_SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
REACT_APP_API_URL=your_backend_api_url
```
